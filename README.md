# Key Features:
### Procedurally Generated Maps:

Every playthrough offers a new experience with randomly generated building layouts, ensuring no two games are the same. Say goodbye to repetitive maps!

### Rescue and Command System:

Locate hostages locked in offices throughout the building by collecting keys to unlock doors. Once found, you can give hostages specific orders—tell them to follow you, hide, or stay put.

### Escort to Safety:

Your mission is to lead hostages back to the designated safe zone, the point where your journey began. But be vigilant—zombies are everywhere, and they’ll attack if given the chance. A single misstep could put hostages at risk.

### Revamped Reward System:

 Earn Coin rewards based on your performance.
 
### Shop System:

  Upgrade items to enhance your gameplay experience.
